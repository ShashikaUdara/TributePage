	    		  		Gangodawila Soma Thero (24 April 1948 – 12 December 2003) was a bhikkhu (Buddhist monk) from Sri Lanka. Following tradition, he used the name of his birthplace, Gangodawila, in front of his name; thero is a term for an elder monk. Soma thero followed the example set by his teachers, Madihe Pannaseeha Theroand Ampitiye Rahula Maha Thero and was both a learned monk and 	as a social reformer. The cause of his death remains in dispute by some.

        	 		<li><strong>The Buddhist Vihara Victoria</strong>
        	 			<br>
        	 			<p>
        	 				The Buddhist Vihara Victoria, a new temple, was established in 1993 at Noble Park. This was established in view of spreading the Dhamma to not only the Sri Lankan community but also other nationalities. At present all religious work is going well. As this premises is not big enough to provide the Buddhist service on a global scale, Soma There bought another convert|5|acre|m2|sing=on block of land with the help of the community to found the [http://www.vihara.org.au/t7/ Sakyamuni Sambuddha Vihara] . 800 trees were planted on the land and necessary plans were drawn up.

        	 			<br>
        	 			<p>
        	 				Venerable Gangodawila Soma Thera of the Vajiraramaya Maharagama died in St. Petersburg, Russia on 12 December 2003 in his 56th year.

        	 		<li><strong>Our Soma Thero</strong>
        	 			<br>
        	 			<p>
        	 				The Melbourne Sri Lanka Buddhist Vihara is in Springvale. Ven. Soma spoke entirely from the Tripitaka, and could cross-reference at will from many discourses to provide a comprehensive picture.
							<br>
							So, what made Soma Hamuduruwo special? For starters, he always called laymen by name, instead of the impersonal 'mahattaya', or a title (which, contrary to popular belief, meant nothing to him), he used each dayaka's given name thereby demonstrating a commitment to them. He appreciated the action, not the person, thus reinforcing a fundamental Buddhist principle.
							<br>
							He considered it his role to point out ways in which laymen's behaviour could be changed to make life more pleasant for them. This he did sometimes quite bluntly, and although it alienated the less edified, those who stuck with him found their lives much enriched and enhanced. The bluntness disguised a lot of karuna and metta, and accepting advice given with such compassion could do only good.
